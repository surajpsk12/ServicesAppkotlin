# 🎶 TheServiceApp - Ringtone Controller

> **An Android application that demonstrates the use of a Service to play and stop the device's default ringtone. It features a visually appealing user interface with custom controls and decorative elements.**

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎵 **Default Ringtone Playback:** Allows users to play the device's default ringtone.
- 🛑 **Stop Ringtone:** Provides functionality to 
stop the currently playing ringtone.
- ⚙️ **Background Service:** Uses an Android `Service` (`MyService.kt`) to manage ringtone playback, allowing it to continue even if the app is not in the foreground.
- ✨ **Custom UI:**
    -   Material Design buttons for Play and Stop actions (`play_button_selector.xml`, `stop_button_selector.xml`).
    -   Decorative elements like a top arc (`top_arc_shape.xml`), sound wave animation (`wave_bar.xml`), and floating circles (`floating_circle.xml`).
    -   Gradient background (`gradient_background.xml`) for a modern look.
- 🔊 **Clear Visual Feedback:** UI elements to indicate playback status (though specific implementation details aren't fully visible from filenames alone).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** XML, Material Components
- **Core Components:** Android SDK (Activities, Services, `RingtoneManager`, `MediaPlayer` or similar for playback)
- **UI Elements:** `ConstraintLayout`, `CardView`, `MaterialButton`, `View` for custom graphics.
